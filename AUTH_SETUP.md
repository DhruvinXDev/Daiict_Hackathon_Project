# Authentication Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate Route Definitions**: Removed duplicate authentication routes from `routes.ts` that were conflicting with the ones in `auth.ts`
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Modified the system to fall back to in-memory storage when database is not available
3. **Input Validation**: Added proper validation for required fields in registration and login
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and added debugging logs

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
# Database Configuration (optional for development)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/career_advisor

# Session Secret (required for authentication)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-change-this-in-production

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing Authentication

### 1. Health Check
Test if the server is running:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health
```

### 2. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User"
  }'
```

### 3. User Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### 4. Get Current User
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/user \
  -H "Cookie: sid=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

### 5. Logout
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/logout \
  -H "Cookie: sid=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

## Frontend Integration

The authentication endpoints are now properly configured and should work with your React frontend. Make sure to:

1. Send requests to the correct endpoints (`/api/register`, `/api/login`, etc.)
2. Include the session cookie in subsequent requests after login
3. Handle the responses appropriately in your UI

## Troubleshooting

- Check the server console for debugging information
- Verify that all required fields are sent in registration requests
- Ensure the frontend is sending requests to the correct server URL
- Check that cookies are being set and sent properly

## Current Status

✅ Authentication routes are properly configured  
✅ Input validation is implemented  
✅ Error handling is improved  
✅ Debugging logs are added  
✅ Fallback to in-memory storage when database is unavailable  
✅ Session management is working  
✅ Health check endpoint is available  

The authentication system should now work properly for both registration and login!
